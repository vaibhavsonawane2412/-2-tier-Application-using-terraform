# 2-tier-Application-using-terraform

‚ú®This repository is created to learn and deploy  2-tier application on aws cloud through terraform. 

## üè† Architecture
![Architecture of the application](https://github.com/AnkitJodhani/3rdWeekofCloudOps/raw/main/architecture.gif)

## üñ•Ô∏è Installation of Terraform

### Create S3 Backend Bucket
Create an S3 bucket to store the .tfstate file in the remote backend

Warning! It is highly recommended that you ```enable Bucket Versioning``` on the S3 bucket to allow for state recovery in the case of accidental deletions and human error.

Note: We will need this bucket name in the later step

### Create a Dynamo DB table for state file locking
Give the table a name
Make sure to add a ```Partition key``` with the name ```LockID``` and type as ```String```

üëâ let install dependency to deploy the application 

```sh
cd root
terraform init 
```

**Note**: we need public key and private key for our server so follow below procedure.

```sh
cd modules/key/
ssh-keygen.exe 
```
above command ask for key name then give `client_key` it will create pair of keys one public and one private. you can give any name you want but then you need to edit the terraform file

edit below file accoding to your configuration
```sh
vim root/backend.tf
```
add below code in book_shop_app/backend.tf
```sh
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "BUCKET_NAME"
    key    = "backend/FILE_NAME_TO_STORE_STATE.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "dynamoDB_TABLE_NAME"
  }
}
```
### üè†Lets setup the variable for our Infrastructure
create one file with the name of `terraform.tfvars` 
```sh
vim root/terraform.tfvars
```

add below contents into `book_shop_app/terraform.tfvars` file
```javascript
REGION                  = ""
PROJECT_NAME            = ""
VPC_CIDR                = ""
PUB_SUB_1_A_CIDR        = ""
PUB_SUB_2_B_CIDR        = ""
PRI_SUB_3_A_CIDR        = ""
PRI_SUB_4_B_CIDR        = ""
PRI_SUB_5_A_CIDR        = ""
PRI_SUB_6_B_CIDR        = ""
DB_USERNAME             = ""
DB_PASSWORD             = ""
CERTIFICATE_DOMAIN_NAME = ""
ADDITIONAL_DOMAIN_NAME  = ""


```

## ‚úàÔ∏è Now we are ready to deploy our application on cloud ‚õÖ
get into project directory 
```sh
cd root
```

type below command to see plan of the exection 
```sh
terraform plan
```

‚ú®Finally, HIT the below command to deploy the application...
```sh
terraform apply 
```

type `yes`, it will prompt you for permission..
